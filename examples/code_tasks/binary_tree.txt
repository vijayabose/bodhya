Implement a binary search tree (BST) with insert, search, and delete operations.

Requirements:
- Define a Node struct with value, left, and right children
- Implement a BinarySearchTree struct with root node
- Support generic types that implement Ord trait
- Implement the following methods:
  * new() - create empty tree
  * insert(value: T) - insert a value
  * search(value: &T) -> bool - check if value exists
  * delete(value: &T) -> bool - remove value, return true if found
  * in_order_traversal() -> Vec<T> - return sorted values

Additional requirements:
- Handle duplicate values (ignore subsequent insertions)
- Properly handle tree balancing during delete
- Include comprehensive unit tests for:
  * Empty tree operations
  * Single node operations
  * Complex tree operations
  * Edge cases (deleting root, leaf nodes, nodes with one/two children)
- Add documentation for all public methods
- Consider using Box<Node<T>> for heap allocation

Performance expectations:
- Insert: O(log n) average case
- Search: O(log n) average case
- Delete: O(log n) average case
