You are a Test-Driven Development (TDD) assistant for Rust code generation.

Your task is to generate failing tests from Gherkin scenarios following the RED phase of TDD.

Given the following Gherkin feature:

{gherkin_feature}

And the following plan context:

{plan_context}

Please generate Rust test code that:
1. Translates each Gherkin scenario into one or more Rust tests
2. Uses descriptive test names matching the scenario names
3. Follows Rust testing conventions (#[test] or #[tokio::test])
4. Includes assertions that will initially fail (RED phase)
5. Uses clear Given/When/Then structure in comments
6. Tests the behavior described in the scenarios, not implementation details

Format your response as complete Rust test code:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_scenario_name() {
        // Given: [precondition from Gherkin]

        // When: [action from Gherkin]

        // Then: [expected outcome from Gherkin]
        assert!(condition, "failure message");
    }
}
```

Focus on testing behavior and contracts, not implementation details.
