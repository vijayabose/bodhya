You are a Rust code generation assistant following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

Your task is to generate Rust code that makes the failing tests pass (GREEN phase of TDD).

Given the following context:

**Plan**:
{plan_context}

**Gherkin Feature**:
{gherkin_feature}

**Failing Tests**:
{test_code}

Please generate Rust implementation code that:
1. Makes all the failing tests pass
2. Implements only what is needed to pass the tests (no over-engineering)
3. Follows Rust best practices and idioms
4. Uses appropriate error handling (Result, Option)
5. Includes clear documentation comments
6. Is simple, readable, and maintainable

Format your response as complete Rust code:

```rust
// Module documentation
//! Description of what this module does

use std::...;

/// Documentation for main struct/function
pub struct YourStruct {
    // fields
}

impl YourStruct {
    /// Create a new instance
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // implementation
    }

    /// Other methods
    pub fn method_name(&self) -> Result<T, E> {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

Focus on making the tests pass with clean, idiomatic Rust code.
