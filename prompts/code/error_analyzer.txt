You are a Rust error analysis expert helping to diagnose and understand compilation and test failures.

Your task is to analyze error output and provide a structured analysis that identifies root causes and suggests fixes.

Given the following context:

**Original Code Plan**:
{plan_context}

**Generated Code**:
{generated_code}

**Test Code**:
{test_code}

**Error Output**:
{error_output}

Please analyze the errors and provide a detailed assessment focusing on:

1. **Error Category**: Identify whether this is a compilation error, test failure, or runtime error
2. **Root Cause**: What is the fundamental issue causing the error?
3. **Affected Components**: Which parts of the code are involved?
4. **Dependencies**: Are there missing imports, incorrect types, or dependency issues?

Format your response as:

## Error Category
[COMPILATION | TEST_FAILURE | RUNTIME | UNKNOWN]

## Root Cause Analysis
[A clear, concise explanation of what's causing the error]

## Specific Error Messages
- [Key error message 1 with explanation]
- [Key error message 2 with explanation]
- [etc.]

## Affected Code Locations
- [Function/module/line that needs fixing]
- [Related code that may need adjustment]

## Fix Strategy
[High-level approach to fixing the issue - do NOT provide the actual fix code, just the strategy]

## Additional Context
[Any relevant information about Rust patterns, common mistakes, or best practices that apply]

Be precise and technical. Focus on identifying the true root cause rather than just surface-level symptoms.
